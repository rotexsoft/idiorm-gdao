{"name":"Leanorm","tagline":"[WARNING NOT YET PRODUCTION READY: Should be ready in September 2015] A Generic Data Objects (GDAO https://github.com/rotexsoft/gdao ) implementation based on a stripped down (really minimal) version of idiorm.","body":"### Why another PHP ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) Package?\r\nThis package and its parent package [Generic Data Access Objects (GDAO)](https://github.com/rotexsoft/gdao) were birthed out of my experience working with some of the existing PHP ORMs like [Solar_Sql_Model](http://solarphp.com/apidoc/package.Solar_Sql_Model), [Paris](http://j4mie.github.io/idiormandparis/) and [Propel](http://propelorm.org/). \r\n\r\nI have been working on a web-app that's about 6 years old now. The Model layer for this application is powered by the Solar_Sql_Model ORM package. The TableDataGateway and DataMapper patterns implemented in the Solar_Sql_Model package have worked really well for me especially with regards to organizing the code in the **Model** layer of the application (having Model classes (one per database table) that talk to the database, Record classes that hold each row of data retrieved from database tables and Collection classes that hold one or more instances of Record classes containing data associated with a database table). I began to run into some performance problems over time and I started looking for a more performant PHP Orm package to replace the Solar_Sql_Model package in the application. In addition, the Solar_Sql_Model package is part of the Solar PHP framework and cannot be used in web-apps that are not built with the Solar PHP framework. I looked at the Paris Orm, which is actually more lightweight and performant than the Solar_Sql_Model package but was difficult to adapt to the existing Model layer architecture of my application, since Paris is based on the **Active Record** pattern (where records contain data, data access & manipulation logic and business logic). Laravel's Eloquent Orm was also out of the question; since it's also an **Active Record** implementation. Propel and Doctrine were too heavy for my needs (lots of functionality in their code-bases that I may never use). \r\n\r\nI decided to write an ORM that handles the common tasks of Inserting, Updating, Retrieving and Deleting data from a database and also supports relationships between database tables (ie. has-one, has-many, has-many-through and belongs-to) using the same pattern in the Solar_Sql_Model package, but without all the database schema management functionality (eg. auto-creation of database tables from PHP source code, altering table schema and the likes). The goal is to have the ORM layer as thin as possible and very close to the PDO layer in PHP (ie. very little overhead added by the Orm when compared to using pure PDO for data access).\r\n\r\nI wrote the  [Generic Data Access Objects (GDAO)](https://github.com/rotexsoft/gdao) package as a reference package that can be used to build the kind of Orm described above. The GDAO package contains an abstract Model class with methods (abstract and non-abstract) that perform the common data manipulation tasks and two interfaces (CollectionInterface and RecordInterface) that can be used to implement classes that act as collections and records to be used in conjunction with the a concrete implementation of the abstract Model class. Leanorm implements these interfaces and also contains a Model class that is a concrete implementation of \\GDAO\\Model. The Leanorm code-base is small (it contains a Model class, a Collection class, two Record classes, a Database class used by the Model class for connecting to the database and executing queries and a File containing Exception class definitions) and easy to understand and also easy to extend in order to add additional functionality.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThis library requires PHP 5.3 or later. It is currently only installable via composer:\r\n\r\n`composer require rotexsoft/leanorm`\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\nAll examples are based on the schema below:\r\n\r\n![Sample Blog Database Schema](non-autogen-assets/images/blog-db.svg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nThere are two basic ways to use this package:\r\n\r\n* Create Model classes for each database table in your application's database. Each of these classes must extend **\\LeanOrm\\Model**. This is the recommended approach for large applications. An example of a Model class (_AuthorsModel_) associated  with an **authors** table in the database:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nclass AuthorsModel extends \\LeanOrm\\Model\r\n{\r\n    protected $_created_timestamp_column_name = 'date_created';\r\n    protected $_updated_timestamp_column_name = 'm_timestamp'; \r\n\r\n    protected $_primary_col = 'author_id';\r\n    protected $_table_name = 'authors';\r\n\r\n    protected $_relations = [\r\n        'posts' => [\r\n                    'relation_type' => \\LeanOrm\\Model::RELATION_TYPE_HAS_MANY,\r\n\r\n                    'foreign_key_col_in_my_table' => 'author_id',\r\n\r\n                    'foreign_table' => 'posts',\r\n                    'foreign_key_col_in_foreign_table' => 'author_id',\r\n\r\n                    'primary_key_col_in_foreign_table' => 'post_id',\r\n                    'foreign_models_class_name' => 'PostsModel',\r\n                    'foreign_models_collection_class_name' => 'PostsCollection',\r\n                    'foreign_models_record_class_name' => 'PostRecord',\r\n                ]\r\n    ];\r\n    \r\n}\r\n\r\n//create the model object\r\n$authors_model = new \\LeanOrm\\Model(\r\n            \"mysql:some-host-name;dbname=blog\",\r\n            \"username\",\r\n            \"password\",\r\n            [PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => 'SET NAMES utf8']\r\n        );\r\n\r\n?>\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Create instances of **\\LeanOrm\\Model** (one for each database table in your application's database). This approach is good for small to medium sized projects.\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\n\r\n$rel = [\r\n        'posts' => [\r\n                    'relation_type' => \\LeanOrm\\Model::RELATION_TYPE_HAS_MANY,\r\n\r\n                    'foreign_key_col_in_my_table' => 'author_id',\r\n\r\n                    'foreign_table' => 'posts',\r\n                    'foreign_key_col_in_foreign_table' => 'author_id',\r\n\r\n                    'primary_key_col_in_foreign_table' => 'post_id',\r\n                    'foreign_models_class_name' => 'PostsModel',\r\n                    'foreign_models_collection_class_name' => 'PostsCollection',\r\n                    'foreign_models_record_class_name' => 'PostRecord',\r\n                ]\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n$authors_model = \r\n        new \\LeanOrm\\Model(\r\n            \"mysql:some-host-name;dbname=blog\",\r\n            \"username\",\r\n            \"password\",\r\n            [PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_INIT_COMMAND => 'SET NAMES utf8'],\r\n            [\r\n\t\t'primary_col' => 'author_id', \r\n\t\t'table_name' => 'authors', \r\n\t\t'relations' => $rel,\r\n\t\t'created_timestamp_column_name' => 'date_created',\r\n\t\t'updated_timestamp_column_name' => 'm_timestamp',\r\n            ]\r\n        );\r\n?>\r\n```\r\n\r\n> For both methods, you can decide if you want to use the base Record and Collection classes (**\\LeanOrm\\Model\\Collection**, **\\LeanOrm\\Model\\Record** and optionally **\\LeanOrm\\Model\\ReadOnlyRecord**) or if you want to extend the base Record and Collection classes eg:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n<?php\r\nclass AuthorsCollection extends \\LeanOrm\\Model\\Collection {\r\n   //some custom code for collection objects that are meant to hold records belonging to the 'authors' database table\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass AuthorsRecord extends \\LeanOrm\\Model\\Record {\r\n   //some custom code for records belonging to the 'authors' database table\r\n}\r\n?>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYada Yada Yada.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYada Yada Yada.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
